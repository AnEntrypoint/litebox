# litebox — current state (2026-09-23)

The authoritative CURRENT-STATE picture of what works, what is broken, and what to do next. Every claim
carries a commit sha or `file:line` so the next session re-verifies instead of re-deriving; a claim
nobody could point at, or one a later commit superseded, is deleted rather than hedged. Reference
detail is drained to `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_*.md` and dated `docs/*.md` in the map below — read those
for a trail, never as a starting point.

Also the single source of truth for standing rules. A future "remember this" belongs here as one
line plus its pointer, not a separate memory file. Compacted at the 65th, 70th, 72nd, 75th, 76th,
81st, 83rd, 85th, 88th and 91st passes (pass-history section below; 26th-69th full narrative:
`docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-22.md`; 70th-90th full narrative, including each pass's own complete
evidence and fix rationale: `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-23.md`). Re-compacted 91st pass (drained
the 88th-90th passes' own full bug-by-bug writeups to the archive, same pattern as the 88th pass's
own prior compaction of 83rd-87th). Still over the 30KB target after the 92nd pass's own addition
(~46KB) — this file's own "Docs and tooling map"/"Closed" sections and older CLOSED pass-history
entries are the next drain candidates for a future pass, once no actively-being-extended entry
would be disturbed (the 92nd pass's own item-1 entry is exactly such an actively-extended entry —
do not drain it until its own `cdb` pickup is resolved one way or the other).

## The cheap repro — start here

```
target/release/litebox_runner_linux_on_windows_userland.exe -Z \
  --oci-image docker.io/library/debian:stable-slim -- /bin/bash -c '<script>'
```

One ~81MB layer, `[cache] HIT` after the first pull, real GNU coreutils instead of busybox (coreutils
`touch` issues the `utimensat`/futimens form busybox's never reaches, `caaac79`). Host-side gotchas:

- **PowerShell, never Git Bash** — Git Bash rewrites `/absolute/guest/paths` into `C:/Program
  Files/Git/...` before the runner sees them (misleading `ENOENT`). `Start-Process
  -RedirectStandardOutput/-RedirectStandardError` makes the runner exit almost instantly with zero
  guest output; use `& .\runner.exe ... *> combined.log` instead.
- **Single quotes only inside `-c`** — embedded double quotes are corrupted crossing into the
  child's Win32 command line (masqueraded as deep fork/stack-pointer corruption for a whole session).
- **`LITEBOX_PROCESS_FORK=1` is a HOST env var, not a guest `--env`** —
  `spawn_cross_process_fork_child` (`litebox_platform_windows_userland/src/lib.rs`) reads it via a
  bare `std::env::var_os` on the HOST side; via `--env` it silently no-ops with ZERO log output
  (looks like "not eligible" but isn't even attempted) — 37th pass.
- **Boot logs from PowerShell redirection (`*> file.log`) are UTF-16LE, not UTF-8** — a plain
  `grep`/`Select-String` silently returns zero matches even when the text is there. Always `iconv
  -f UTF-16LE -t UTF-8` (or `Get-Content -Encoding Unicode`) first — 53rd pass.
- **`*> file.log` WORD-WRAPS any tracing line longer than ~116-119 chars across MULTIPLE physical
  lines, no continuation marker** — data isn't lost, only split (repro: `python -c
  "sys.stderr.write('A'*300)" *> f` → 3 physical lines for 1 logical write). A naive line-based
  grep/regex over a long DEBUG line sees only the first ~116-119 chars (70th). **Fix**: a physical
  line NOT starting with the `<float>s` timestamp prefix is a continuation — rejoin before regex.

**Log level**: default is `warn,litebox_platform_windows_userland::fork_verify=error` (`fork_verify`
pinned to `error` since it warns per single-stepped instruction). Don't add `LITEBOX_LOG=error` by
reflex; use `fork_verify=warn` for a fork heal. Bare `LITEBOX_LOG=debug` is useful but too noisy for
a full boot. **Prefer the two dedicated low-overhead targets over any blanket module target**:
`litebox_diag::process_timeline=debug` (five `DIAG_TIMELINE` lines, system-wide, cheap) and
`litebox_diag::socket_read=debug` (read()/recvfrom() payload previews, narrow with
`LITEBOX_DIAG_SOCKET_READ_TARGET=<comm>`, unset = every process, 74th) — both far cheaper than the
old `litebox_shim_linux::syscalls::{process,net,file,unix}=debug` recipe (~70+ call sites/module
flooded across every concurrently-forked process during a boot's fork storm).

## Standing lessons and hard constraints

- **No WSL/hypervisor ever** — run under the matching runner (`litebox_runner_linux_on_windows_
  userland.exe`/`litebox_runner_linux_userland`); cross-compiling FOR Linux is fine, running the
  result in a VM defeats the premise.
- **`fork_verify.rs`'s stale-pointer-healing bug class is Windows-only** (real `fork()` gives
  identical child addresses) — never port it to another platform's crate.
- **Never `bcdedit /debug on`** without a kernel debugger attached — two full-host freezes so far.
- **A process spinning in a dead-locked allocator/spinlock resists `Stop-Process -Force`** — use
  `Invoke-CimMethod -MethodName Terminate` (WMI). `cdb -p <pid>` must use `-pv`/`qd`, never bare `q`
  (kills the target).
- **Never run two full-stack verifications concurrently** — starves both, looks like a real hang.
  Kill every `litebox_runner` between runs; watch `FreePhysicalMemory`, kill on a falling trend.
- **`LITEBOX_DUMP_FRAMES=1` is the only trustworthy `--gui` visual check**, never `PrintWindow`/
  `CopyFromScreen` — decode via `advisor/probes/decode_frame.py`, correlate against `DIAG_TIMELINE
  execve`'s real argv0.
- **Never time litebox with one host process per datapoint** (bare spawn costs 1.6-2.3s) — run N
  iterations in ONE guest process; never subtract timestamps across a parent log and a fork-child
  log (`init_logging()` resets elapsed time to ~0 per child).
- **Release-binary `cdb` reads are unreliable** (MSVC ICF folds distinct functions into one symbol)
  — build `cargo build -p litebox_runner_linux_on_windows_userland` (no `--release`) for any `cdb`
  session needing a trustworthy stack.
- **Refusal errno choice is API contract** — EPERM lets callers degrade, EINVAL/ENOSYS fails them
  hard; wrong choices have silently broken whole subsystems before (30th-pass AF_UNIX
  `EAGAIN`-vs-`EINPROGRESS` fix is the newest instance).
- **Proving a run took the cross-process fork path needs `[process_fork_diag] task-resume-probe`
  lines, never the shim's eligibility log** — the latter fires regardless of outcome (archive).
- **An fd subsystem being "uncarriable" across a cross-process fork doesn't mean the fork must be
  refused** — pipes/regular files/eventfds ARE carried; close-on-exec and pty fds are safely
  DROPPED and the fork proceeds (a pty, unlike a socket, is RE-OPENABLE by id via `SharedPtyTable`);
  only genuinely unrecoverable kinds (unix-socket) refuse. Check `try_cross_process_fork`'s match
  arms (`litebox_shim_linux/src/syscalls/process.rs`) before assuming a new kind needs old
  treatment. Run dbus-daemon non-forking; for XFCE use `xfce4-session`, never `startxfce4`.
- **`wait4()`/`kill()` to a cross-process fork child are asymmetric** — `kill()` to a
  `cross_process_children`-tracked pid returns `ESRCH` unconditionally (documented gap: reachable
  via `wait4`, just not signalable yet).
- **A `socketpair(2)`-originated fd (both ends `Unnamed`) is NOT safe to drop as CLOEXEC across a
  cross-process fork** — real processes (`dbus-daemon`'s babysitter) use it for pre-`exec()`
  bookkeeping; `raw_fd_is_addressless_unix_socket_pair` (`net.rs`) refuses it (falls back to
  thread-based fork) rather than silently dropping it (54th).
- **A `TypedFd`'s index is only valid against the SAME `Descriptors` instance that `insert()`ed
  it** — reading one back against a different process's table is out-of-bounds or resolves to an
  unrelated entry; every accessor in `litebox/src/fd/mod.rs` returns `None` rather than panicking
  (`faa74c6`) — same class as the `Network::queued_for_closure`/`Pipes.litebox`/`FutexManager` bugs.
- **A `de_only.sh`/`LITEBOX_PROCESS_FORK=1` boot's RAM floor is NOT a fixed ~3.1-3.3GB plateau — it
  depends on concurrent HOST load, can fall well below 1GB free** (73rd, 4/4 `de_only_xcensus_
  seed2.tar` boots: collapse to 500MB-1.5GB free within ~10-20s of `xfce4-session`'s fork tree
  starting). `taskkill /IM litebox_runner…exe /F /T` reliably recovers RAM even from <500MB-free;
  watch `FreePhysicalMemory` throughout, kill on a FALLING TREND not a fixed number. **Confirm the
  release binary's mtime postdates the newest relevant commit before trusting a boot result** (57th
  caught a ~1hr-stale binary this way). See Track B item 1.
- **`de_only_xcensus_seed2.tar` (NOT `de_only_seed.tar`) reaches `DE_LAUNCHED_DIRECT` in ~10-15s and
  does NOT hit the 71st-pass `gpg-agent`/`iceauth`/`ssh-agent` dead end** (4/4, 73rd) — preferred
  harness, ~10x faster to `xfwm4`-launch than `webtop_stack.sh`. **`de_only_xcensus_seed3.tar`**
  (75th, disk-only) is the same seed with its `/tmp/xcensus.py` round trip rewritten to feed
  `python3` via stdin instead of a `/tmp` file — seed2's census always failed `rc=2` ENOENT
  (writable-layer-visibility gap on `/tmp`); seed3 returns real data (`rc=0`). Use seed3.
- **A bare file redirect (`cmd > /tmp/f` + a later sibling's read) used to fail silently under
  `LITEBOX_PROCESS_FORK=1`, same root cause the 75th pass fixed (`1d449e6`)** — not yet re-verified
  for a literal `>` specifically, so prefer a PIPE or `$( )` when in doubt: `cmd 2>&1 | sed
  's/^/[tag] /' &` for streaming, `VAR=$(external-cmd)` for captured output (44th-pass fix).
- **`.wfgy/webtop_stack.sh` is NOT what boots — `.wfgy/webtop_seed.tar` embeds a FROZEN COPY**
  (`--resume-from`); editing the host script alone changes nothing. Re-tar after every edit (stage,
  overwrite, `tar -cf webtop_seed.tar webtop_stack.sh tmp config`), verify with `tar -xOf ... |
  grep`. Found the hard way: the 35th pass's `/dev/tcp` rewrite was still absent from the tar on
  the 38th pass — never once ran in a guest.
- **A boot whose log stops is usually a DEAD ROOT RUNNER, not a hang** — when the root process dies,
  `[s]` markers stop while orphaned cross-process children (Xvfb, selkies) keep burning CPU, reading
  like a stall. Check `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='litebox_runner…'"`'s
  `CommandLine.Length` — a cross-process CHILD has the bare 77-char exe-only command line
  (`process_fork.rs:1594-1599`); if no survivor carries the full `--oci-image…` args, the root is
  gone (RAM pressure → OOM-kill).
- **Before ANY `cdb` attach, set `LITEBOX_DIAG_NO_EXTERNAL_FAULT_WATCHDOG=1` and
  `LITEBOX_DIAG_NO_FAULT_WATCHDOG=1`** — every runner spawns a watchdog (`process_fork.rs:4391`)
  that `TerminateProcess`es after 15s of <10ms CPU delta, killing a debugger-frozen target.
- **Socket read/write tracing (69th-74th; full mechanism: archive)**: `sys_write`/`sys_writev` log
  under `syscalls::file`, not `net` (`file.rs:1847`/`2990`). A socket fd's `read(2)`/`readv(2)` is a
  SEPARATE path from `recvmsg(2)` — real Xlib/XCB Xtrans uses plain `read()`/`write()` (root cause,
  71st, of the 70th pass's X11-reassembly desync). `run_on_raw_fd` (`lib.rs:1702`) splits socket fds
  into `net` (generic TCP) and `unix` (`UnixSocketSubsystem`, what X11/D-Bus use) — the 71st pass's
  `litebox_diag::socket_read` diagnostic only instrumented `net` (fixed 73rd, `fc830d1`, mirrored
  onto `unix`). Blanket `syscalls::file=debug` is unusable on a real boot (50MB+/s of guest time,
  destabilized a boot enough to break `xdpyinfo`, 71st) — use `litebox_diag::socket_read` instead,
  optionally `LITEBOX_DIAG_SOCKET_READ_TARGET=<comm>[,<comm>...]` (74th; unset = every process).
- **`FlushingStderr` (`litebox_runner_linux_on_windows_userland/src/lib.rs`) does one locked
  `write_all`+`flush` per tracing EVENT, in `Drop`** — closes a real interleaving window across
  concurrent guest (=Windows) threads the prior separate lock/write/lock/flush had. Fixed; NOT the
  70th pass's X11-reassembly desync explanation (that gap was the `read()`/`recvmsg()` split above).
- **All five `DIAG_TIMELINE` sites log at `debug!` on their own `litebox_diag::process_timeline`
  target**, not nested under `syscalls::process`/`syscalls::signal` (~70 unrelated sites each; 74th)
  — use `LITEBOX_LOG=warn,litebox_platform_windows_userland::fork_verify=error,litebox_diag::
  process_timeline=debug` for cheap whole-boot coverage. A cross-process fork child's guest pid IS
  its real Windows PID (`runner…/lib.rs:1673`), so `DIAG_TIMELINE execve`'s `pid=` is `cdb -pv -p`-able.
- **On host-side crashes, use `advisor/probes/symbolize_litebox_crash.py`, snapshotting `.exe`+`.pdb`
  next to the log** — a ring dump's `rva=` is only meaningful against the exact emitting build.
- **Isolate the harness before blaming litebox** — launch guest probes directly as the runner's
  top-level program, never via a runtime-built `/bin/sh -c` wrapper. Never trust a container tag
  name for its WM/session contents — verify by registry manifest + blob tar-listing or a live
  in-guest `/usr/bin` listing. Never record a test count not watched run to completion; never leave
  a suite red for an environmental reason. **The 53rd pass's "`xfce4-session` startup depth varies
  run to run" was itself a RAM-exhaustion artifact (fixed 56th/57th)** — 58th pass's 3/3 clean runs
  all reach the identical depth (`iceauth`+`ssh-agent` spawned, then hangs — Track B item 1).
- **Repo hygiene** — packed layer tars, frame dumps and debug logs never go in git (`.wfgy/`,
  gitignored); untrack anything `git add -A` sweeps.
- **Guest-reachable code returns an errno, never a panic** — the host process IS the entire guest
  session, so an `unimplemented!()`/`unreachable!()`/panic, or unbounded recursion, on any
  guest-reachable path kills every guest process at once (OOM, metadata ops, open flags, nested
  `epoll_ctl`, corrupted guest contexts — full fixed-bug list with shas: archive).

## Cross-process fork (`LITEBOX_PROCESS_FORK=1`)

A genuine `D == 0` fork — child at the SAME addresses, no relocation, no `fork_verify` healing —
exists as `spawn_cross_process_fork_child` (`advisor/ADVISORY-002-d-zero-fork.md`), short-circuiting
to a native fork when available (the fd-carrying apparatus is Windows-only scaffolding for a
missing syscall). **Correctness-sound**: zero corruption on a `bash -c` loop repro vs the
thread-based default's 100% tcache-corruption rate (ADVISORY-001 §3N is thread-path-only).

**Eligibility** — an already-borrowed fd table, a beyond-stdio fd that isn't a pipe end/path-recorded
regular file/eventfd/close-on-exec/pty (overridable by `LITEBOX_PROCESS_FORK_IGNORE_FDS`), or an
unsanitizable `fs_base`/context. No by-name gate exists (34th) — only this global opt-in env var
plus the per-fork fd-kind scan; the only remaining blocking kind on a real `debian-xfce` boot is
`unix-socket`. Fork-child GPR/vmem-adopt cost is small (~1.2s, down from ~3.5-5s); the rootfs
index-merge cost the 56th pass fixed is NOT the dominant per-fork cost any more (confirmed 100%
cache-hit, `LITEBOX_DIAG_FORK_TIMING=1`, 75th: real per-fork rootfs cost ~83-140ms). The real
per-fork-count cost is each fork being a separate Windows process with its own ~350MB-1.1GB peak
working set (guest-memory emulation, writable-layer import, rootfs materialization — not yet
decomposed; see Track B item 1). **`live_cross_process_fork_children`** (`GlobalState` field,
`litebox_shim_linux/src/lib.rs`, 76th) is admission control capping concurrent cross-process-fork
children at 6 (`Task::reserve_cross_process_fork_slot`/`release_cross_process_fork_slot`,
`syscalls/process.rs`, fails open ~8s) — real but only PARTIAL mitigation, see Track B item 1.
Still open: nginx's own SSL-cert generation fails on its first startup attempt, not root-caused
(`docs/track-b-fork-fix-progress.md:146-152`).

**Pass history (4th-82nd, 2026-09-17/23)**: full narrative in the dated archives ("Docs and tooling
map" below). Condensed current-state trail:

- **43rd-74th (FIXED/REFUTED, live-verified; archives: `_2026-09-22.md`/`_2026-09-23.md`)**: both
  Xvfb SIGSEGVs; D-Bus activation's dropped-CLOEXEC-fd bug; `fd/mod.rs:422` panic; per-fork
  rootfs-rebuild RAM cost (56th); `ssh-agent`/`xfwm4` permanent freeze
  (`RawMutex::WaiterQueue::with_lock`, 60th/61st); `SharedUnixConnectQueue::cancel`'s slot leak
  (62nd); `DBUS_FAILED` root-caused+fixed (a byte-size regression guard discarding a healthy fresher
  writable-layer export, 67th/68th). REFUTED: `/defaults/xfce/` readdir, dbus-daemon babysitter
  SIGKILL, epoll-readiness, GLX/compositor blocker theories. 70th-74th: root-caused two
  logging/capture gaps hiding `xfwm4`'s own X11 traffic (`do_read`'s socket branch is separate from
  `do_recvmsg`; the `unix` closure, not just `net`, needed the `socket_read` diagnostic); added
  low-overhead `litebox_diag::process_timeline`/`socket_read` targets; independently reproduced a
  `GetAllProperties` D-Bus call re-issuing every ~10.7s forever (mechanism unconfirmed, still open).
  `DE_FAILED`/RAM collapse (host process count peaking ~30) survived all of it.
- **75th-82nd (condensed; full narrative for each: `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-23.md`)** — 75th:
  **`xfwm4` launches for the first time ever**, root-caused+FIXED (`1d449e6`) a writable-layer
  export-path fallback bug that had silently broken filesystem-write visibility on EVERY
  `--oci-image` boot, ever (RAM crater at `WM_POLL n=6`/11 windows, `DE_UP` not reached). 76th: first
  direct host-side capture of the crater process tree (33 processes/~10.5GB), landed admission
  control (`live_cross_process_fork_children`, caps 6 concurrent) — real but partial (slower growth,
  same eventual 28-29-process/<1GB-free magnitude); reframed as cumulative per-process peak RSS
  across a real XFCE session's >6 necessarily-concurrent daemons, not a scheduling problem. 77th:
  root-caused+FIXED (`621ee1a`) a real 2x host-allocator commit-doubling bug (~35-40%
  per-process reduction, confirmed not sufficient alone) and found, by code reading, fork's own
  unconditional full-VMA-copy (no COW for shared-library pages) as the next candidate. 78th:
  measured that theory instead of guessing — real but moderate (~29% of copied bytes), declined as a
  bad trade against ADVISORY-001's bug history. 79th: measured (not guessed) that the dominant real
  case is fork-then-immediate-`execve()` with ~85% of cycle time wasted on the eager copy; scoped a
  genuine per-page lazy-population primitive as the real fix, correctly declined to implement it
  without a COW/page-fault mechanism in hand. 80th: confirmed by live measurement that tightening the
  admission cap further is a dead end (same crater ceiling, just slower) — closes cap-tuning as a
  lever. 81st: code-reading-only investigation of a narrower deferred-copy variant, found a SECOND
  correctness obstacle (a plain `fork()` child may legally write memory pre-`execve`, unlike
  `vfork()`'s POSIX-guaranteed non-write contract) — re-confirms 79th's decision, no shortcut exists.
  82nd: the two remaining "quick, safe" levers (zero-byte-skip; XFCE autostart trimming) tested and
  confirmed genuinely exhausted — neither touches Windows' own `VirtualAlloc2(MEM_COMMIT)` charge —
  narrowing the whole investigation to the one remaining candidate, genuine per-page lazy population.
- **83rd-87th (compacted; full narrative: `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-23.md`'s "83rd-87th pass full
  narrative" section)** — implemented lazy (reserve-then-commit-on-fault) fork memory
  (`litebox_platform_windows_userland/src/lazy_fork_commit.rs`, `LITEBOX_LAZY_FORK_COMMIT=1`), a
  real measured win for the dominant fork-then-`execve` case; found and fixed three real bugs
  along the way (two general cross-process-fork bugs unrelated to laziness itself — a
  guest-mmap/64KiB-alignment-padding collision, and forked children never inheriting the parent's
  `sigreturn_trampoline` address — plus the lazy-specific active-`%rsp`-group bug); found, but did
  NOT fix, Bug 4: a genuine TOCTOU — a lazily-serviced page fault reads the parent's CURRENT
  memory, not a true point-in-time-at-fork snapshot, unsafe for fork-WITHOUT-`execve` (subshells/
  daemons) since the parent can keep mutating its own heap after `fork()` returns. Investigated and
  ruled out two fix candidates (real section-object COW: infeasible without a disruptive allocator
  rewrite; fork-time snapshot: forfeits the dominant case's own win) before converging on and fully
  designing a THIRD: single-generation software COW via guard pages, correctness-sound only for
  exactly one outstanding (fork-time-to-fully-serviced) lazy child per parent at a time — closed
  design gaps: per-parent-process (not tree-wide) claim scope; a double-checked-state read
  protocol closing the design's own TOCTOU; and `VIRTUAL_PROTECT_LOCK`/`fork_verify`-VEH
  coordination, matched against the codebase's own `write_usize_fault_tolerant` precedent. Both
  `LITEBOX_LAZY_FORK_COMMIT` and the not-yet-existing guard-cow flag stayed default OFF throughout;
  `DE_UP` not attempted in any of these passes.
- **88th-90th (compacted; full narrative: `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-23.md`'s "88th-90th pass full
  narrative" section)** — 88th: IMPLEMENTED single-generation guard-page COW
  (`LITEBOX_LAZY_FORK_GUARD_COW=1`), found+fixed a real guard-cow-specific hang (Bug 5) via an
  actual boot attempt, then reached further than any prior pass (stable 2.8-4.5GB free, 9-16
  processes, `DE_LAUNCHED_DIRECT` → `WM_POLL` → a real X window) before the same pre-existing
  `DE_FAILED`/`_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK` gap. 89th: reconfirmed the RAM fix across 2 more boots;
  root-caused `DE_FAILED` to a REAL, live `xfce4-session` process crash
  (`exit_code=3221225477`=`STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`, ~16-31s after thread start) on the OLD
  thread-based-fork path, unrelated to lazy/guard-cow; first live `cdb` attach on a cross-process
  fork child achieved but inconclusive (sustained attach perturbs the target's own timing). 90th:
  root-caused the crashing fork to a genuine `CLONE_VFORK` and fixed two real architectural bugs
  this uncovered (a vfork child's blind fresh `PageManager` risking silent live-parent-memory
  corruption on `execve`; a regression that fix itself caused in `release_memory`/`Vmem::duplicate`
  sweeping up the parent's own memory) — both live-verified (`Xvfb` no longer crashes; `xfce4-session`
  reaches real GTK/ICE startup). **The original `xfce4-session` crash itself — `STATUS_ACCESS_
  VIOLATION` ~16-16.7s after its own start, immediately after its own `vfork()` of `/bin/sh`, with
  ZERO `[veh]`/panic output anywhere in the log — survived both fixes unchanged, still OPEN going
  into the 91st pass.**
- **91st — root-caused the 90th pass's "ZERO `[veh]`/panic output" mystery to a real, independently
  DOUBLY-documented (two prior sessions, `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-03.md`'s converged finding,
  cross-referenced this pass) `GS_BASE` corruption class, and landed the exact fix that finding's
  own writeup specified as the concrete next step — but could NOT live-verify it against the
  specific `xfce4-session` crash this session, because 3/3 real boot attempts (1 pre-fix, 2
  post-fix) all died from a DIFFERENT, earlier, already-known crash before `xfce4-session` even
  launched.** Read `WindowsUserland::init_thread_gs_base`/`restore_thread_gs_base_if_cleared`'s own
  doc comment (`litebox_platform_windows_userland/src/lib.rs:185-222`), which already documents:
  "Investigated live while chasing a reliably reproducible `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` INSIDE
  `ntdll.dll` itself (`is_in_guest=false`, a NULL-pointer read, looping forever at the identical
  instruction under nested `vfork()`'s added kernel-transition pressure) -- this repair alone did
  not resolve that specific crash (its true cause is still open, see FINDINGS.txt)". Cross-checked
  `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-03.md:5643`, an INDEPENDENT prior session that hit the identical
  mechanism via a cleaner path (Windows' own Application Error event log): `0xc000000d` in
  `ntdll.dll` at a fixed offset, disassembled to `mov %gs:0x60, %rcx` — the single most fundamental
  TEB/PEB access in the OS — meaning `GS_BASE` itself is invalid at the moment of fault. **Why
  litebox's own repair can't catch this**: `restore_thread_gs_base_if_cleared` only runs from
  INSIDE `vectored_exception_handler` (`lib.rs:865`) or `syscall_handler`'s own entry
  (`lib.rs:11834`, already added by a prior pass per its own doc comment) — but Windows' exception
  dispatcher must ITSELF read `GS_BASE`-relative TEB/PEB state to even locate and invoke a
  registered VEH callback, so when `GS_BASE` breaks badly enough, the OS's OWN dispatcher faults
  before litebox's VEH ever gets control — structurally explaining zero `[veh]` output for a real,
  fatal fault. **The residual gap, precisely**: `syscall_handler`'s entry-point repair only runs
  ONCE, before a syscall's own handling begins — but `RawMutex::block_or_maybe_timeout`
  (`lib.rs:6585`, what `Process::wait_for_vfork_done` — `syscalls/process.rs:551` — calls to
  implement vfork's POSIX-mandated parent-suspension) can legitimately block for many real seconds
  (matching the 16-16.7s observed crash timing) INSIDE that single syscall dispatch, via a loop of
  repeated, chunked `WaitForSingleObject` calls (`LIVENESS_CHECK_INTERVAL`-bounded even for a
  nominally-infinite wait) — each one a real kernel round-trip, and exactly the kind of
  "scheduling-pressure" event this codebase's own FS_BASE-reset precedent (`docs/
  veh-exception-handler-design.md`) already ties this Windows quirk to, but with NO repair
  anywhere in this specific loop before this pass. **Fix** (`litebox_platform_windows_userland/
  src/lib.rs`, `block_or_maybe_timeout`): call `WindowsUserland::restore_thread_gs_base_if_cleared()`
  immediately after every `WaitForSingleObject` return in this loop, before matching on the result
  — closes the gap for every `RawMutex::block`/`block_or_timeout` caller in the whole codebase
  (not just vfork), for one cheap `rdgsbase`-and-compare per wait wakeup/liveness tick. Builds
  clean (debug), no regression in reachability to `DE_LAUNCHED_DIRECT` across 2 post-fix boots.
  **Not live-verified against the target crash**: all 3 real `de_only_xcensus_seed3.tar` attempts
  this pass (1 baseline pre-fix, 2 post-fix, `LITEBOX_DIAG_FATALDUMP=1`, both watchdogs disabled)
  died from an EARLIER, already-known, unrelated crash — a `bash` task (consistently `pid=80
  tid=80` across the two post-fix runs, same ~114-121s guest-time window) taking a fatal `SIGSEGV`
  inside `/de_only.sh` itself, cascading into the ROOT process's own unrecoverable AV
  (`[diag-unrecov-av-terminate] rip=0x0 addr=0x0`) shortly after `DE_LAUNCHED_DIRECT` — before
  `xfce4-session` is ever reached at all. This matches the general, long-documented
  ADVISORY-001 §3N thread-based-fork tcache corruption class (dozens of `fork_verify: stale
  CODE pointer` / `AV-path stale rip livelock` lines active around each crash), not a regression
  from this pass's own fix (the SAME early flakiness — `PROBE_XSET rc=139`, `XCENSUS_PRE_DE
  rc=139` — appeared identically in the pre-fix baseline run too). **Next pickup**: get a boot
  PAST this earlier `bash` crash (may need re-running several times given this project's own
  documented ~33-66% per-boot flakiness rate, or investigating whether this specific `pid=80`
  signature is itself newly severe enough to warrant its own fix) to reach `xfce4-session`'s own
  vfork window and confirm/deny whether this pass's `GS_BASE` fix resolves the original crash;
  the `GLIBC_TUNABLES`-propagation question (89th/90th) remains untested too. Host RAM 4.7-5.8GB
  free throughout, no concurrent boots, all three runs cleanly self-terminated (no WMI kill needed).
- **92nd — the `bash pid=80` crash did not reproduce (0/5 boots), so the 91st pass's `GS_BASE` fix
  could finally be tested against the real `xfce4-session` crash — and was DISPROVED live: a new
  `LITEBOX_DIAG_GS_BASE_REPAIR=1` diagnostic fired zero times across 3 full boots while the
  identical `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` crash still occurred every time. Found the exact, fully
  deterministic faulting guest RIP via Windows' own Application Error event log
  (`rip=0x00007fefe92bc7cb code=0xC0000005`, byte-identical across all 3 independent boots) — real,
  reproducible, invisible to litebox's own VEH logging. Ruled out lazy-fork-commit/guard-cow as a
  simple on/off cause (live test: removing guard-cow makes things categorically worse, not better).
  Full evidence, exact commands and the precise next-pickup cdb target: this file's own item-1 entry
  under "Open, in rough priority order", below.
Fully DONE (kept only as a marker so a future pass doesn't re-attempt): the minimal isolated
cross-process AF_UNIX repro; the `Network` shared-arena redesign's `socket_set`/
`LocalPortAllocator`/`closing_in_background`/`queued_for_closure` slice; DISPLAY/`getenv()` as the
`DE_FAILED` cause; AF_UNIX `connect()` `EAGAIN`-vs-`EINPROGRESS`; `pty_registry`/
`daemon_pty_masters` (`syscalls::pty::SharedPtyTable`, live-verified cross-process); fork's
fd-eligibility scan dropping a redirected 0/1/2 (`raw_fd_is_plain_stdio_device`);
`SharedUnixConnectQueue`'s cancel-on-first-non-blocking-miss gap (`UnixStreamState::Connecting`);
both Xvfb SIGSEGVs.

**Open, in rough priority order:**

1. **`xfwm4` now launches (75th pass, `1d449e6`) — the blocker is no longer filesystem visibility,
   it is pure host-RAM/process-count exhaustion before `DE_UP`.** CLOSED sub-issues:
   `ssh-agent`/`xfwm4` freeze (60th/61st); `DBUS_FAILED`'s regression-guard cause (67th/68th); the
   writable-layer export-path fallback bug (75th); the RAM crater (76th-88th, lazy fork-memory
   population + single-generation guard-page COW, both default OFF behind `LITEBOX_LAZY_FORK_
   COMMIT=1`/`LITEBOX_LAZY_FORK_GUARD_COW=1` — a real boot ran its full ~195s window without
   cratering, reaching `DE_LAUNCHED_DIRECT` → `WM_POLL` → a real X window). Full narrative for
   75th-90th: `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-23.md`'s "88th-90th pass full narrative" section and
   this file's own compacted 88th-90th pass-history entry above.
   **Current blocker (90th-91st pass)**: `xfce4-session` itself dies `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`
   ~16-16.7s after start, immediately after its own genuine `CLONE_VFORK` of `/bin/sh`, with ZERO
   `[veh]`/panic output — 90th pass fixed two real, unrelated vfork-detach architectural bugs
   (`VM_FOREIGN_LIVE_NEVER_REPLACE`) that this crash survived unchanged. **91st pass root-caused
   the "zero VEH output" mechanism**: independently DOUBLY-documented (`docs/
   AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-03.md:5643`, cross-referenced this pass) `GS_BASE` corruption under
   "nested vfork() kernel-transition pressure" — the OS's own exception dispatcher needs valid
   `GS_BASE` to even locate/invoke a registered VEH callback, so when it breaks badly enough
   (confirmed independently via `ntdll!mov %gs:0x60,%rcx` faulting), Windows' dispatcher faults
   before litebox's VEH ever runs. Landed the fix that prior finding's own writeup specified: GS_BASE
   repair now also runs after every `WaitForSingleObject` wakeup inside `RawMutex::
   block_or_maybe_timeout` (`litebox_platform_windows_userland/src/lib.rs`), not just at VEH/
   syscall-entry — closes the gap for `wait_for_vfork_done`'s own many-seconds-long blocking wait
   (previously unrepaired). **NOT yet live-verified against the target crash**: 3/3 real boot
   attempts this pass (1 pre-fix baseline, 2 post-fix) all died from a DIFFERENT, earlier,
   already-known `bash` crash (`pid=80`, general ADVISORY-001 §3N thread-fork tcache corruption,
   identical in the pre-fix baseline too — not a regression) before `xfce4-session` was ever
   reached.

   **92nd pass — the `bash pid=80` early crash did NOT reproduce (0/5 boots), letting the GS_BASE
   fix finally be tested against the real target, and DISPROVED it with live evidence.** Added a
   cheap, permanent, zero-cost-when-off diagnostic (`LITEBOX_DIAG_GS_BASE_REPAIR=1`,
   `VehGates::gs_base_repair`, resolved once via the existing pre-resolved-gate pattern, not a
   fresh `std::env::var_os` inside the VEH itself) that logs every time `restore_thread_gs_base_
   if_cleared` actually observes-and-repairs a cleared `GS_BASE`, at all three call sites. **Result,
   3 independent full boots with it on: ZERO repairs fired in any run, yet `xfce4-session` crashed
   with the IDENTICAL `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` signature every time** (`elapsed_ms_since_thread_
   start` 17160/16542/16402) — `GS_BASE` is never observed cleared at `vectored_exception_handler`'s
   entry, `syscall_handler`'s entry, or `block_or_maybe_timeout`'s wait loop during this crash's
   whole lifetime, so the 91st pass's fix, while real and harmless, does not explain or resolve
   this specific crash. **New decisive evidence via Windows' own Application Error event log**
   (`Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Application';ProviderName='Application Error'}`,
   filtered to `Faulting module name: unknown` = a guest-address fault) pins down the exact faulting
   guest RIP across THREE independent boots: **`rip=0x00007fefe92bc7cb code=0xC0000005`, byte-for-
   byte IDENTICAL every time**, cross-checked against each run's own `task-resume-probe (child,
   winpid=…)` line to confirm each one really is that run's own `xfce4-session` (winpids
   0x4710/0x63B0/0x5778). A deterministic, identical crash RIP across independent boots (different
   fork trees, different timing) rules out random heap corruption as the direct mechanism and points
   at a specific, reproducible code path — yet litebox's own runner log has ZERO `[veh]`/
   `[diag-unrecov-av]` output for this fault in all three runs, even with `LITEBOX_DIAG_FATALDUMP=1`
   on throughout (confirmed still firing correctly for every OTHER real fault in the same logs) —
   the fault reaches the OS's real unhandled-exception path (WER) while staying totally invisible to
   litebox's own instrumentation. **Ruled out lazy-fork-commit/guard-cow as a simple on/off cause,
   tested live**: `LITEBOX_LAZY_FORK_COMMIT=1` alone (guard-cow unset) does not fix this — it causes
   markedly WORSE, widespread early corruption instead (114+ processes exiting via signal almost
   immediately, zero `DIAG_TIMELINE execve` entries logged at all) and `xfce4-session` itself dies as
   an immediate, loud, correctly-delivered GUEST `Segmentation fault` (bash's own job-control
   message) rather than the silent host AV — matching the already-documented Bug 4 TOCTOU risk for
   fork-without-`execve` on real long-lived daemons, and confirming guard-cow is necessary (removing
   it makes things broadly worse), not itself simply "introducing" this narrower residual crash from
   nothing. Both flags fully OFF cannot be tested within the RAM budget (craters to <1GB free by
   `WM_POLL n=4`, well before `xfce4-session` could reach its own 16-17s crash window — confirmed
   live, aborted via WMI `Terminate` on a falling-RAM trend per this file's own safety rule). **Net
   effect**: falsifies the 91st pass's leading theory with real evidence (not just "unverified"),
   and produces a new, deterministic, reproducible data point the *next* pass should use as its cdb
   breakpoint target directly. **Next pickup, precise**: a live `cdb -pv` attach (debug binary; set
   both `LITEBOX_DIAG_NO_EXTERNAL_FAULT_WATCHDOG=1` and `LITEBOX_DIAG_NO_FAULT_WATCHDOG=1` first) on
   a fresh cross-process `xfce4-session` child, breaking on `exception_callback`'s own entry (NOT
   `vectored_exception_handler` generally — the 84th pass found that function's compiled layout is
   sensitive enough to extra instrumentation to regress unrelated repros) and single-stepping toward
   guest `rip=0x7fefe92bc7cb` to identify what code is actually there (which shared library/glibc/
   gtk/dbus function — Windows' own event log cannot symbolize a guest address) and what it was
   doing when it faulted; none of the existing `[lazy_fork_commit]` diagnostic lines carry a pid/tid
   today, so this pass could not cheaply correlate a specific fault-servicing event to this crash
   beyond the on/off test above — adding that tag would help narrow whether this exact page was ever
   lazily serviced. `GLIBC_TUNABLES` propagation to `xfce4-session`'s own environment (89th/90th)
   remains untested too. `LITEBOX_DIAG_FORK_VMA_BREAKDOWN=1` (zero cost when off) remains the
   permanent tool for measuring any future fix's real payoff. `DE_UP` has not been reached by any
   pass through the 92nd; chrome-devtools MCP was `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` when checked this pass (moot, no
   boot got close enough to a real desktop). Lower-priority, still open: (a) decompose remaining per-fork cost between
   rootfs materialization staying resident post its cheap (~83-140ms) build vs. Windows loader
   overhead; (b) use `de_only_xcensus_seed3.tar`'s working `/tmp/xcensus.py`
   (`XCENSUS_SELECTION`/`XCENSUS_ROOTPROP`) + `LITEBOX_DIAG_SOCKET_READ_TARGET=xfwm4` to check
   whether the ~10.7s `GetAllProperties` retrigger (69th/70th, still unconfirmed) recurs; (c)
   unconfirmed: `LITEBOX_LOG` may not reach forked children's own stderr — see `_2026-09-23.md`.
2. `SharedUnixConnectQueue`'s cancel-on-claim-race slot leak — FIXED 62nd (`unix.rs`); didn't
   resolve item 1's symptom. Other AF_UNIX exhaustion paths still silent (38th, `unix.rs`):
   `SharedUnixAddrPresenceTable` capacity-256 overflow; a key >108 bytes; backlog ignored on
   cross-process accept. Abstract sockets CORRECT.
3. `SafeZoneAllocator`'s `spin::mutex::SpinMutex` still has no dead-holder recovery — lower-urgency
   theoretical risk (the live `ssh-agent`/`xfwm4` freeze once blamed on it was actually `RawMutex`'s
   `WaiterQueue::with_lock`, CLOSED 60th/61st), not tied to any live symptom now.
4. Debugger-root-cause `litebox/src/event/wait.rs:224`'s `unreachable!()` on garbage thread state
   (dozens/boot, most frequent historical panic, NOT yet debugger-confirmed — don't patch blind).
5. `flock_registry`/`drm`/`evdev` (`GlobalState` fields) remain open, same non-POD-payload obstacle
   `SharedPtyTable` is a template for; `timerfd`/`signalfd` are the next-cheapest carriable fd kinds
   before `socket`/`unix-socket`/`epoll`; the writable-layer-visibility gap for LARGE content
   (`/tmp/de.log` etc.) needs its own chunked-publish design, not a widened `SharedFilePublishTable`
   cap. All three lower-urgency, not on the Xvfb/selkies boot path.

## Container images and OCI loading

**`litebox_packager --oci-image <ref> --output <tar>`** pulls, whiteout-merges, rewrites every ELF and
produces a bootable flat tar in one command — supersedes the ad-hoc OCI-pull Python scripts this
project once hand-rolled, retired, do not recreate.

**Runtime in-memory loading** — `--oci-image <ref>` pulls, merges and rewrites every layer in memory;
no host directory is created for the rootfs (a real one hit three Windows-path bugs). Rewritten
layers cache under `.litebox-cache/`, keyed so a rewriter change self-invalidates.
`tar_ro.rs`'s multi-layer index is built ONCE at mount, not per read (was O(entries²), 17.3s →
0.35s fixed) — and, as of the 56th pass, ONCE per boot tree rather than once per fork child too
(`TarRo::live_entries_after_merge`/`from_merged_live_entries`, "Cross-process fork" section below).
Cache internals, the four fixed OOM bugs, tag-verification detail: archive.

Tags verified live, never from the name: `linuxserver/webtop:alpine-mate` ships MATE not XFCE;
`alpine-xfce` doesn't exist; `debian-xfce`/`ubuntu-xfce` ship real XFCE.

**X server choice**: for on-screen DRM/wgpu (`--gui`) use `Xorg` with `modesetting` — litebox's
virtual DRM is legacy-KMS + dumb-buffer + XRGB8888 only (no atomic modeset/GBM/EGL), so a
GBM-first compositor lands on its least-tested fallback and `Xvfb` never touches DRM/KMS at all.
For browser/selkies, `Xvfb` IS correct — its `-shmem` framebuffer works now SysV shm exists.

## A real desktop renders in a browser

**XFCE renders in a real host browser, and MATE too** — full pipeline (Xvfb, selkies/pixelflux
x264, MIT-SHM) inside litebox, reverse proxy host-side only. Working config: selkies
`--addr=0.0.0.0` port **8081**, dashboard over `--publish`, `/websockets` tunnelled to 8081.
Fourteen litebox defects got here, all landed (archive).

**A stock s6-overlay image boots with no flags/stubs**: `/init` runs 16 cross-process children with
zero uncarriable fds. The once-deterministic black XFCE desktop is fixed (runtime rewriter was
corrupting `libLLVM.so.19.1`'s `.dynsym`, mesa `dlopen` failed forever). Rest: archive.

**XFCE also renders on the THREAD-based fork path, gated by one flag** (`docker.io/linuxserver/
webtop:debian-xfce`, `.wfgy/webtop_stack.sh`). Without it, 3/3 boots die ~7s in to ADVISORY-001
§3N's safe-linked-tcache write. Fix: `--env GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.malloc.tcache_count=
0:glibc.malloc.mxfast=0` as a GUEST-side `--env` flag (workaround, THREAD-path only).
`LITEBOX_PROCESS_FORK=1` removes that crash class by construction and no longer hits the old
"Fork-after-Xorg" freeze either (35th). A `de_only.sh` boot runs its whole 60s+160s window with
ZERO crash/OOM as of the 57th pass. `DE_FAILED` still fires — NOT "Cannot open display" (refuted,
52nd), NOT RAM exhaustion (57th) — see Track B item 1 for current blockers. Selkies also needs
`--clipboard-enabled=false` on the thread-based path (its clipboard monitor re-triggers the same
corruption every tick) — moot cross-process.

**Open here.** One client per selkies instance, no slot reclaim on reload. A second, distinct
glibc/tcache corruption signature (`double free or corruption (out)` SIGABRT) still sporadically
hits selkies on the THREAD-based fork path under heavy fork load — Track B territory; don't
re-attempt `GLIBC_TUNABLES` without evidence of a third mechanism.

**ACK-stall-kill and port-8081 watchdog — both CLOSED (2026-09-16)**: `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-16.md`.

## Host-side crash machinery

A fatal host fault dumps before it dies, ungated (stack walk, `RECENT_FAULTS` ring, `RECOVERY_LOG`,
no env var needed); a real OS minidump comes only from the repeated-identical-fault circuit
breaker. An unexplained `0xC0000005` may be a panic — the VEH handler enters only for the four
codes it triages, registers FIRST in the chain (`docs/veh-exception-handler-design.md`).
Cross-process sync on Windows: every native address/TID-based wait is process-local
(`WaitOnAddress`, keyed events, `NtAlertThreadByThreadId`=ACCESS_DENIED); only a shared kernel
object crosses processes — `RawMutex` (below) is the one that matters; `xproc_sync.rs`'s
named-event primitive is live-verified but still unwired.

## Shared-memory foundations -- all DONE, live-verified 2026-09-16/17/22 (full mechanism: archive)

`RawMutex` no longer calls `WaitOnAddress`/`WakeByAddressSingle` (process-local per MSDN) -- a
manual wait queue + cross-process kernel `Event`s, with `poisoned: AtomicBool` owner-death
recovery. A small 64 MiB `shared_kernel_arena_alloc` backs `SharedArc<T>` for
`LiteBoxX`/`GlobalState` placement (NOT wired to `GlobalAlloc`; `SLAB_ALLOC` stays
private-per-process). **Root cause of the whole `GlobalState`-sharing class**: `SharedArc::new`
shares only `T`'s literal inline bytes -- a `BTreeMap`/similar registry has its NODES on the
private per-process heap, meaningless to an attaching process. Of the original uncarriable-registry
list (`unix_addr_table`/`pty_registry`/`daemon_pty_masters`/`flock_registry`/`fifo_registry`/
`sysv_shm`/`memfds`/`shared_files`): all but `flock_registry` are fixed (per-process-shadowed, a
shared-arena fixed array, or — for `pty_registry`/`daemon_pty_masters` — both a shadow AND a
live-verified cross-process companion, `syscalls::pty::SharedPtyTable`). `sysv_shm` moved to
per-process named-object mapping (51st). Reusable pattern (`SharedUnixAddrPresenceTable`, reused
by AF_UNIX/`SharedPtyTable`): fixed-slot, pure-atomic, lock-free `(kind, key bytes<=108, owner
pid)` side-index. **A mutable-state table on this pattern needs every WRITE path audited for
shared-side mirroring** — `SharedPtyTable`'s own setters originally only reached the local side
(37th-pass live catch). Still open: `flock_registry` (pty's pattern is a template);
`SafeZoneAllocator::alloc`'s spinlock livelock (no dead-holder recovery unlike `RawMutex`).

## Closed — do not re-attempt without a genuinely new approach

VEH_FRAME_STRIDE canary guard, `dev_bench`/`litebox_runner_snp` build failures, CoW-mmap
performance, input-latency bugs, presenter-split duplicate-`SYN_REPORT`, the GUI-protocol
