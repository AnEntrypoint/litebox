# litebox — current state (2026-09-03)

This file is the authoritative, up-to-date picture of what works, what's broken, and what to do
next. It replaces the previous pass-by-pass chronological log, which accumulated thousands of
lines of retracted hypotheses alongside real findings. The full prior history (every pass,
including every dead end) is preserved at `docs/AGENTS_ARCHIVE_2026-09-03.md` for anyone who
needs the detailed forensic trail — but start here, not there.

## Standing goal

Get XFCE actually rendering and staying up under litebox on a Windows host (no WSL, no
hypervisor — see `feedback_no_wsl_or_hypervisor` in project memory). **Not yet met.** See
"Open blockers" below for the precise remaining gap.

## Standing directives (do not relitigate these)

- **Never conserve token/context budget.** No instruction anywhere says to throttle effort or
  stop at a token threshold. Work at full effort until the actual goal is met. If genuinely near
  a context ceiling, let auto-summarization handle it or checkpoint via a commit — never
  preemptively cut work short and frame it as budget conservation.
- **Always build debug/observability tooling proactively while investigating**, not just enough
  to explain the current bug. Several real bugs this session were only found because someone
  built a general tool (dependency auditor, preflight checker, per-process stderr capture)
  instead of continuing to guess from interleaved logs.
- **Use `/gm` to drive non-trivial coding tasks.** Zero branches or worktrees — work on `main`.
  Commit only as `lanmower`, never attribute anything to Claude/AI.
- **The success oracle for a launch run is `non_black_pixels > 0` in the FINAL frames of a run**
  (via `LITEBOX_DUMP_FRAMES=1`), not "any frame anywhere in the run." A run can render a correct
  desktop for 20+ seconds and then go black — that is not success. This distinction cost real
  time this session (a claimed "XFCE working, sustained 30+ seconds" turned out to be weston's
  own render, with the screen already black by the time XFCE's own components started).
- **Exit code is not a valid success oracle either.** A run can exit 0 while several forked
  children were silently killed by fatal signals. Count "fatal signal" lines in
  `LITEBOX_LOG=error` output directly.

## What's confirmed working (do not re-investigate)

- **litebox's DRM/display emulation is sound.** Mode enumeration, dumb-buffer allocation, the
  pixman renderer, and swapchain creation all work correctly against the real virtual DRM output
  ("Virtual-1"). Verified via targeted DRM-ioctl logging and direct frame inspection.
- **weston renders a complete desktop reproducibly** under litebox (`--use-pixman
  --shell=desktop-shell.so`), independently confirmed across many runs this session
  (`non_black_pixels=2073597`, the canonical full-1920x1080-desktop signature).
- **labwc is NOT the right compositor to keep pursuing.** It unconditionally creates a transient
  0x0-dimension headless output on startup as a documented upstream workaround (`src/server.c`,
  `wlr_headless_add_output(backend, 0, 0)` immediately destroyed) — normal on real hardware where
  the create-destroy completes before anything renders to it. Under litebox's timing, something
  renders/modesets it inside that window, hitting wlroots' `assert(width > 0 && height > 0)` in
  `wlr_swapchain_create` and aborting. This is real upstream behavior interacting with litebox's
  timing, not a litebox display bug — use weston instead; it's already proven working.
- **Windows fork-emulation machinery (`fork_verify.rs`) is Windows-only by architecture.** Real
  Linux/macOS `fork()` gives the child identical virtual addresses for free and never needs this
  machinery — never assume a `fork_verify`-attributed crash needs investigating on those
  platforms, and never port a `fork_verify.rs` fix there.

## Real bugs found and fixed this session (all committed on `main`)

1. **Layer packaging: `tar` drops SONAME symlinks.** Extracted layer tars kept only the versioned
   filename (`libX11.so.6.4.0`) for hundreds of shared libraries, never the plain SONAME
   (`libX11.so.6`) the dynamic loader actually looks up — because `tar` doesn't reliably recreate
   a symlink before its target exists on extraction. Silently broke `xfwm4`, `xfdesktop`,
   `xfce4-panel`, and hundreds of other binaries (946 of 1696 ELFs in one measured layer). New
   tools: `advisor/probes/audit_layer_deps.py <extracted-root>` (scans, reports every unresolved
   `DT_NEEDED`, zero exit code = clean) and `advisor/probes/fix_layer_sonames.py <extracted-root>`
   (creates the missing links from each `.so`'s real `DT_SONAME`, idempotent, `--dry-run`
   available). Also `advisor/probes/preflight_layer.sh` — a fast, fail-loud check of a layer
   before spending a full run on it (shell/loader present, `ld-musl` search path present, zero
   unresolved deps, at least one X client, session XML present).
2. **Host-crash race: `unmap_shared_memory` unsynchronized against `update_permissions`.**
   `litebox_platform_windows_userland/src/lib.rs`'s `unmap_shared_memory` (`UnmapViewOfFileEx`)
   was the one Windows VAD-tree mutator in the file not serialized under `VIRTUAL_PROTECT_LOCK`,
   unlike every other allocate/deallocate/protect path. A guest process's real `munmap()`/exit
   teardown of a shared mapping could race a different thread's concurrent `mprotect()` on the
   same region: the region gets freed between `update_permissions`'s `MEM_COMMIT` query and its
   actual `VirtualProtect` call, which then observes `MEM_FREE`, fails with a spurious
   `ERROR_SUCCESS`, and trips an `assert!` that panics the whole host process. Fixed by adding the
   missing lock guard (18 lines). Verified: previously guaranteed a host panic within ~46s of an
   XFCE launch; post-fix, a full 100s run produced zero panics. Commit `984927b0`.
3. **`sys_mprotect` bitmask gap, `remove_mapping` clamp scoping, `VmArea`/`rangemap` coalescing
   bug, `deallocate_pages` missing MEM_MAPPED guard, `memfd` mmap-time wipe bug.** Multiple real
   memory-management correctness fixes landed earlier this session — see git log
   (`3a0755e4`, `140c1711`) for full detail. None were the cause of the crashes described below,
   but all are real, verified fixes worth keeping.
4. **`protect_mapping` caller attribution.** Every call site of `Vmem::protect_mapping` now tags
   its caller (`guest_mprotect` / `make_pages_*` / `create_mapping` / `fork_duplicate`), so a
   future protection-related crash can be attributed to its actual origin in one log read instead
   of hours of inference. This tooling investment paid for itself directly this session.

## Open blockers (the real remaining gap)

**Single highest-priority item: a concurrent-fork_verify-healing-pass race kills forked children
before they can `execve()`.** This is the one thing standing between the current state and the
standing goal. Full mechanism, established via careful controlled experimentation (see
`project_advisor_forked_child_text_not_present` in project memory for the complete forensic
trail if needed):

- Reproduces on a **bare alpine rootfs with zero display components** — no weston/Xwayland/XFCE
  needed. A background/concurrent-fork shell pattern alone triggers it.
- Six-condition controlled comparison gave clean statistical separation: sequential execution or
  `&` immediately followed by `wait` never crashes; `&` with children that exit almost
  immediately crashes; `&` with children that stay alive 5-8s with **no exits during the test
  window** still crashes (ruling out "child exit" as the trigger); a global lock serializing
  execve's entire address-space transition did **not** reduce fault counts (ruling out execve's
  own setup as the race site).
- Best-supported current mechanism: `fixup_stale_elf_data_pointers`'s `healed_count` (inside
  `fork_verify.rs`'s stale-pointer-healing pass) plateaus at a stable number across
  clean/sequential runs but grows unbounded under concurrent forking, with a clean dose-response
  relationship to both concurrency level and fault count. Directly measured: pairing
  `diag-fv-lifecycle: begin`/`end` log lines to count MAX CONCURRENT healing passes correlates
  almost perfectly with faults (MAXCONCURRENT==1 → 0/8 clean runs faulted; MAXCONCURRENT>=2 →
  27/33 runs faulted, scaling with concurrency).
- Concretely, this kills `dbus-daemon`'s forked child before it reaches `execve()` in a typical
  XFCE launch, which cascades: no D-Bus session bus → `xfconfd`/`xfsettingsd`/`xfce4-panel` all
  fail with "Connection refused" → `xfce4-session` launches zero children. This is why the
  desktop currently goes black by the end of a run even with the DRM/weston/host-panic layers all
  working correctly — everything downstream of dbus never gets its settings/session
  infrastructure.
- Regression oracle (sub-second to a few seconds, litebox host + bare rootfs, no display stack
  needed):
  ```
  FAIL case (must go to 0 faults after a real fix):
    i=1; while [ $i -le 30 ]; do /bin/true & i=$((i+1)); done; sleep 2
    (currently: 3,3,5 "fatal signal" log lines per run)

  PASS control (must STAY at 0 — don't break this while fixing the above):
    i=1; while [ $i -le 10 ]; do sleep 5 & sleep 0.3; i=$((i+1)); done; sleep 6
    (currently: 0,0,0)
  ```
- Hypothesis, not yet confirmed by a landed fix: `fork_verify`'s relocation/healing state is
  likely scoped per-address-space (shared across every concurrently-live guest process, since
  Windows fork emulation gives them all the same real address space) rather than properly
  per-child, and/or isn't correctly retired when one child's healing completes while another
  concurrently-forking child's pass is still active.

**A fresh agent is (or was, check its status) actively working this specific bug as of this
entry** — check for a recent commit before starting from scratch.

## Reproduction commands

Full XFCE launch (once the fork bug above is fixed, use this to verify the standing goal):
```
cd C:\dev\litebox-main
cargo build --release -p litebox_runner_linux_on_windows_userland --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
export LITEBOX_LOG=error
export MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL="*"
export LITEBOX_DUMP_FRAMES=1
timeout 100 target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/litebox_runner_linux_on_windows_userland.exe \
  --initial-files .wfgy/xfce-build/layer31_direct_fixed.tar \
  --gui \
  -- /bin/sh /xfce_direct.sh \
  > /tmp/pass_repro.log 2>&1
```
(`layer31_direct_fixed.tar` = `alpine-pinned2.tar` + `layer31_direct.tar` merged, soname-repaired.
If missing, rebuild: extract both into one directory, run
`python advisor/probes/fix_layer_sonames.py <dir>`, then `tar cf layer31_direct_fixed.tar -C <dir> .`)

Bare-rootfs fork-bug repro (fast, no display stack): see the regression oracle above.

## Useful techniques discovered this session

- **Guest stdout is interleaved character-wise with litebox's own log lines** in the runner's
  captured output, making a crashing guest program's own diagnostic messages unreadable via
  normal line-based grep. Recovery: `sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' run.log | tr -d '\n' | grep -oE
  ".{N}PATTERN.{M}"`. A proper fix (`LITEBOX_GUEST_STDOUT_FILE`, routing guest pty output to its
  own file) exists but currently only activates under `--pty-mode`, which itself has a bug — it
  breaks the top-level shell with SIGPIPE in a non-interactive harness context. Worth fixing
  properly if picked up again; in the meantime, redirect each guest process's own stderr to a
  file inside the launch script (`cmd > /tmp/cmd.log 2>&1 &`) and `cat` it — this is what
  actually recovered real error messages (e.g. "xfsettingsd: Could not connect: Connection
  refused") this session.
- **`Exception(N)`/`error_code` decoding**: `cr2=0x0` and `error_code=0x0` together rule out a
  page fault (both are always set for `#PF`) — that combination means `#UD` (invalid opcode), an
  instruction that decoded to invalid bytes, not a jump to unmapped memory. `rip==cr2` with a
  nonzero `error_code` whose low bit is set (e.g. `0x6`) means an instruction-FETCH fault on a
  not-present page — a genuine missing/unbacked mapping.
- **A stale non-socket file at a well-known path blocks the real daemon from starting.** A
  resumed writable layer can leave e.g. `/run/seatd.sock` as a regular file instead of the real
  socket from a prior run, causing `seatd -l debug &` to silently refuse to start
  ("Non-socket file found at socket path... refusing to start"). Always `rm -f` well-known socket
  paths at the top of a launch script when resuming from a prior writable layer.
- **A missing `--resume-from`/`--initial-files` file panics the runner with a stack overflow**
  instead of a clean error (`lib.rs:338` and `lib.rs:679`, both `.unwrap()` on a file-open
  result) — if you see "thread 'main' has overflowed its stack" right after an "os error 2" (file
  not found) message, the actual bug is your invocation, not litebox itself. Worth fixing these
  two `.unwrap()`s to a graceful error + exit if touched again.
- **The program path passed to the runner must be RELATIVE, no leading slash** (`bin/sh`, not
  `/bin/sh`) — a leading slash also hits the same ENOENT-then-stack-overflow panic shape above.
